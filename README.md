![image](https://github.com/Cydral/FFspider/assets/53169060/532c096d-d06f-433c-902a-049985cd26c7)
<p><i>Colorify is a black and white image colorizer based on Dlib. It uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the mapping from black and white images to color images. The GAN is trained on a dataset of over 55,000 images, and it is able to colorize images in a realistic and natural way.</i></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Colorify is a C++ program that leverages the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to automatically colorize black and white images using a DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) architecture. The program takes a grayscale image as input and generates a corresponding colorized version where the pixel values have been determined by a generative AI model.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Colorify program is designed to bring life to monochromatic images by applying state-of-the-art image colorization techniques. It employs a DCGAN, a type of GAN composed of two networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The Generator network is built on a U-Net architecture, while the Discriminator network utilizes a series of filters with or without activation. This combination allows Colorify to learn and replicate intricate color patterns, producing visually appealing colorizations.</p>

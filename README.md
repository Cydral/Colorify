<p><i>Colorify is a black and white image colorizer based on Dlib. It uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the mapping from black and white images to color images. The GAN is trained on a dataset of over 55,000 images, and it is able to colorize images in a realistic and natural way.</i></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Colorify is a C++ program that leverages the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to automatically colorize black and white images using a DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) architecture. The program takes a grayscale image as input and generates a corresponding colorized version where the pixel values have been determined by a generative AI model.</p>

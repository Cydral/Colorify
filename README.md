<i>Colorify is a black and white image colorizer based on Dlib. It uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the mapping from black and white images to color images. The GAN is trained on a dataset of over 55,000 images, and it is able to colorize images in a realistic and natural way.</i>
